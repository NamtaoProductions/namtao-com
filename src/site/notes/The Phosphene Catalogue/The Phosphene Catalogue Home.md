The Phosphene Catalogue is a 1970s mail-order catalogue, specialising in those items that cannot be sold at other auction houses: Paintings of lost origin, statues that are too grotesque for public display, and books better left unread...

# Inspiration

The idea of an urban fantasy podcast of tape recordings by the curator of a secretive London-based art auction house is a synthesis of a few things.

## Croft Mill

The inspiration for the show is from the Croft Mill catalogue is where a catalogue would have text descriptions of fabrics, but no pictures!

## Within The Wires

TPC is kind of _"Season 2 of Within The Wires": THE SHOW_. I adore WTW SO much, my goodness, and season 2 was presented in a format I wanted more of. So I wrote it. https://www.nightvalepresents.com/withinthewires/

## The Magnus Archives

Though I started listening to TMA rather late, it had been on my to-listen list for many years. After I produced the pilot episode of TPC, so many people shouted at me to go listen, I relented! I made some tweaks to the format of the show to make it more and less like TMA. I borrowed a few things that were excellent, but clarified the distinctions between the two settings.

# Naming

## Phosphenes

> [!QUOTE] Title
> A phosphene is the phenomenon of seeing light without light entering the eye. The word phosphene comes from the Greek words phos (light) and phainein (to show). Phosphenes that are induced by movement or sound may be associated with optic neuritis. Phosphenes can be induced by mechanical, electrical, or magnetic stimulation of the retina or visual cortex, or by random firing of cells in the visual system. Phosphenes have also been reported by meditators (called nimitta), people who endure long periods without visual stimulation (the prisoner's cinema), or those who ingest psychedelic drugs.
