> [!INFO] How to read the scripts
>  Normal text, like this, is read by the narrator (typically [[Projects/The Phosphene Catalogue/Jude Francis-Sharp\|Jude Francis-Sharp]]).
>> Quoted sections, like this, are asides that the narrator does not intend to be printed, and can be more casual, perhaps muttered or spoken slightly off-mic.
