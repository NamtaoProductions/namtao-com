I make mistakes all the time.

Whenever I realise this, I update the video, article, or post with clear ERRATA:
- For my YouTube videos, it's in the pinned ERRATA comment. (YouTube do not let you edit videos after publishing, annoyingly)
- For my articles, I ~~strikethrough~~ the error and append with the corrected text and a date footnote^[(2025-06-24)]
- For my mastodon and other social posts, I edit the original post and follow-up in a reply.

The way to report errors on any of my work, regardless of what format you saw it in (hey, maybe I'll write a book one day!) is to file an issue on this GitHub repository:
https://github.com/NamtaoProductions/namtao-com/issues

I attempt to check all video comments in the first week after publishing, but error reports after this initial period should be posted to the above address.

Thank you very much for helping me improve my accuracy, this journalistic integrity is so important to me.
