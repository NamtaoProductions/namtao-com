Scripts for my talks on the YouTube channel.
up to the 42nd are in <https://github.com/0atman/noboilerplate>, then I switched to publishing them here on this site.

I build these using [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) and the [advanced-slides plugin](https://github.com/MSzturc/obsidian-advanced-slides): I take each slide, printscreen it, and splice it with my audio using [reaper.fm](http://reaper.fm/).

# Recommended Rust Reading

Here are some great resources that I used to teach myself:

- The Book
https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/

- Everything on fasterthanli.me, starting with
https://fasterthanli.me/articles/understanding-rust-futures-by-going-way-too-deep

- Rust By Example (follows the same chapter ordering to The Book)
https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/

- Rustlings code kata, learn by fixing tiny failing tests
https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings

- My video series on Rust (of course!) playlist here, watch "How to Learn Rust" first (which contains my recommended set up) and then the rest in any order:

- My Discord server, especially in `#programming` and `#newbie-advice`. There's a huge community of friendly folks here, answering questions on Rust all day every day. Do tag me and say hi!

Have fun, and good luck!
