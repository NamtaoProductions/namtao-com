# Errata

> Especially in the early seasons, I didn't have as comprehensive system to keep track of facts and figures in my writing, so there are some mistakes.

- in episode 1.1 I called the station 6 a "fission reactor"
    - From episode 1.2, I called it what it actually is: A "thermoelectric generator"
- Up to season 8, I called the ESA station that Seth is talking to, "Mission Control"
    - after about Season 10, he calls it "Ground Control"
    - This is not necessarily an error, though I did it unconsciously, as there's no mission anymore.
- the Valentina Vacuum Research Lab was first named in 11.1
    - But then in all future episodes of s11 called it Valentia (no 'n'), this was incorrect.
- in 11.5 Redwing calls Dr Yuán by the given name "Li Na", which is not right. I don't know how this error got into the script.
    - in 0.3 I corrected this to [[Lost Terminal/Dr Yuán\|Yùmíng]].
