# Code for www.namtao.com

Head to <https://www.namtao.com> to see the site.

Poke around here if you're interested, the site is built using the amazing [Digital Garden Obsidian Plugin](https://github.com/oleeskild/Obsidian-Digital-Garden), which selectively commits individual markdown files to this repo using the github API. This allows me to keep most of my 5000+ notes private, while convieniently publishing those I want.
